# TetraPlex

Welcome to TetraPlex, the internet platform that uses anonymity as a means to drive communication, knowledge and understanding.

We are open source and open to collaborators henceforth additional features maybe raised as issues using this [feature template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).
